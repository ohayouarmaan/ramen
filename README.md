# Ramen - An opensource Backend Framework

Just another ✨Backend API Framework✨ for javascript
## The plan
Currently it's just me trying to create a javascript framework for making APIs. This is definitely inspired if not copied from the Express framework

the `Server` class in `main.js` file can be initialized which will create an HTTP server and you can use the listen function to listen to a specific port

the `Request` class in the `Request.js` file holds the request object which can be used to access all the properties for the http request.

### Done:
* [ x ] Initialize the project
* [ x ] Create a request class
* [ x ] Create a server class
* [ x ] add a test file
* [ x ] Create a response class
* [ x ] Create a middleware system
* [ x ] Add query parameters

### TODO:
* [  ] add respond features in the response class
* [  ] plan future features
* [  ] think about database connectivities
